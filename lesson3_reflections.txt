*Reflect: When to Use a Remote Repository
When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is a good form of backup, for safety.
A remote repository is ideal, verging on madatory, for working with others.

*Reflect: Manuam vs automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
An automatic pull would be like a merge of the branch on GitHub and the one I have, and it would happen when git or github decided it should happen and thus could cause problems for me at an inopportune time.
