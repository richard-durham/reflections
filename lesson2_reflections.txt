Lesson 2 Reflections

* Reflect: Initializing a Repository
What happens when you initalize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, Git creates the .git file, and takes an inventory of what is in the directory/repository.
Without the inital inventory, Git would not know what it had to work with.
