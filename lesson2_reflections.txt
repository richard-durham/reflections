Lesson 2 Reflections

* Reflect: Initializing a Repository
What happens when you initalize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, Git creates the .git file, and takes an inventory of what is in the directory/repository.
Without the inital inventory, Git would not know what it had to work with.

* Reflect: Staging Area
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is simply a list of the files currently under consideration for a commit.  This allows the user to see, clearly and simply, what is to be included in the commit.  This clarity should reduce likelihood of a bad commit (i.e. including too few or too many files).
